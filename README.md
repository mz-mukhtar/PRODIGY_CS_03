# Password complexity Checker

This project is part of my Prodigy interniship program, which is building a simple python-based command-line tool to check the strength of passwords

## Fetures


- Input is hidden while typing (for security)
- Evaluates password based on:
  - Length (minimum 8 characters)
  - Presence of lowercase letters
  - Presence of uppercase letters
  - Inclusion of numbers
  - Use of special characters
- Provides:
  - A score (out of 5)
  - A strength label: **Weak**, **Moderate**, or **Strong**
  - Personalized improvement suggestions

## Future Enhancemets
- Check against common password dictionary
- Random strong password generator (--generate flag)


## Installation
